Hi! I am:
 - Senior Scientific Developer at AspenTech Subsurface Science and Engineering, Brisbane in the Geolog R&D office.
 - A student of the James Cook Uni Masters in Data Science Program
 - A husband and father to two little people
 - A technology enthusiast
 - A lawn care enthusiast 

I'm OK with there not being a straight forward answer to everything. I constantly sharpen my analytical skills in the hopes that when shit hits the fan my accumulated judgement will lead me to more right decisions than wrong decisions.
